# Sailor Moon Pomodoro Timer

Technologies: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery

The Pomodoro Technique was developed by Francesco Cirillo as a time management
technique to promote productivity and efficiency. The general idea is to break 
down a larger task/project into a set of timed intervals separated by short 
breaks. 

My project is a simple Pomodoro Timer that is Sailor Moon themed! â˜ª 
The timer is customizable with a session being 1-60 minutes and break 1-30 
minutes long. 

Features:
- Able to pause and resume during any session
- Able to restart session 
- Separate increment and decrement buttons for both types of sessions
- Alarm goes off at end of session
- Window prompts user at end of session if they would like to restart session
- Sailor Moon photo slideshow every 15 seconds
